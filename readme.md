# Portfolio
Files for my online portfolio, which is compiled to a static site using Nanoc.

### Development
Development is done through Vagrant. Once the VM has been provisioned with the necessary software, the files in `/vagrant/` can be compiled by running `bundle exec nanoc` or `bundle exec guard -p -l 3` to poll for changes. The site can be viewed with `bundle exec nanoc view`, and the corresponding port will be forward to `localhost:8080` on the host machine.

#### Docker
To build the resum√© with Docker:

    docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source=$PWD,target=/tmp tianon/latex \
      latexmk -recorder -pdf /tmp/content/latex/kate_hart_resume.tex \
      -aux-directory=/tmp/content/latex/ \
      -output-directory=/tmp/content/latex
