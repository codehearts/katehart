<p>I'm a <abbr title="systems administrator">sysadmin</abbr> and web developer who's currently studying computer science at the University of Rochester. Most of my experience is with Linux systems and web development with PHP, although lately I've been branching off into Python and Ruby (this site was built using Nanoc).</p>
