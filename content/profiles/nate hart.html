<p>I'm a <abbr title="system administrator">sysadmin</abbr> and web developer who's currently studying computer science at the University of Rochester. I maintain a cluster computer for the political science department and volunteer my time as the tech maintenance director for the Computer Interest Floor. A lot of my work involves Linux systems and scripting languages such as PHP or Python, although I can also work with low-level languages like C.</p>
