<p>I'm an embedded systems developer at Genie Industries, who recently graduated from the University of Rochester with a B.S. in computer science. My interests lie with Linux, C, and Python, which I use frequently for the numerous projects I've taken on in my free time. I used to be more involved with web design and development, but I've found that my heart is more with systems.</p>
