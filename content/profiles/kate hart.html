<p>I'm an embedded systems developer at Genie Industries and recent graduate from the University of Rochester with a B.S. in computer science. My interests lie with Linux, C and Python, which I use almost constantly for the numerous projects I've taken on in my free time. I've also spent a long time working on web projects, although my heart is more with systems.</p>
