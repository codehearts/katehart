<p>About Life is a book that examines the philosophical questions the author faced as he escaped from Vietnam and adapted to life in the United States. I was approached by the author to create a promotional website for the book where he could continue to share his thoughts.</p>

<p>The home page is an interactive version of the bookâ€™s cover that presents visitors with questions faced by the author and allows them to read excerpts from those parts of the book. There is also a blog where the author continues to write, as well as links for purchasing a copy of the book.</p>
