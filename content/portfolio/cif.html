<p>In 2012 I was elected webmaster for the University of Rochester&rsquo;s Computer Interest Floor, a group of individuals who host seminars and provide tech support for the University community, alongside other technical offerings. I decided that CIF needed a new face for its online properties and began redesigning the site over the summer following my freshman year.</p>

<p>The first step was creating a universal design for all of their sites. The design itself will be adaptive, fitting to whatever device it&rsquo;s displayed on. Their public site was moved to WordPress, which I tweaked to be more friendly to future editors who may not be very tech-savvy. After that, there's plenty of code from previous CIF members to refactor and prepare for the new design. Once everything&rsquo;s been updated to use the new design, I&rsquo;ll be considering new features and content to add while corresponding with CIF&rsquo;s tech officers.</p>
